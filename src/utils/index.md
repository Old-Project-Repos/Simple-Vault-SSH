will contain only the pure functions

These rules are the fundamental foundation of how pure functions work. Pure functions follow the following set of rules.

1. A pure function does not use any external data to obtain the return value.
   In other words a pure function uses only the inputs of the function to get the return value.
2. A pure function has no side effects.
    This means when you run a pure function it does not change anything outside the function.
3. A pure function will give the same output every time as long as the inputs remain the same.
